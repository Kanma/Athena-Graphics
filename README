- Summary
---------------------------------------

Athena-Graphics is one of the modules of the Athena Game Framework, in the form
of a library written in C++.

This module provides concrete implementations of the visual & debug components
of the 'entities system' implemented in Athena-Entities. It also contains some
graphics-related utility classes.

The 3D rendering engine used is OGRE (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine,
http://www.ogre3d.org).

The use of this module is optional, you can choose to implement your own
components instead.
