---------------------------------------
- Summary
---------------------------------------

Athena-Graphics is one of the modules of the Athena Game Framework, in the form
of a library written in C++.

This module provides concrete implementations of the visual & debug components
of the 'entities system' implemented in Athena-Entities. It also contains some
graphics-related utility classes.

The 3D rendering engine used is OGRE (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine,
http://www.ogre3d.org).

The use of this module is optional, you can choose to implement your own
components instead.


This module can be used as a standalone library, or combined with the rest of
the Athena Game Framework (http://github.com/Kanma/Athena-Framework).

Additionally, when the Athena-Scripting (http://github.com/Kanma/Athena-Scripting)
module is built alongside this one, Athena-Graphics will be usable from JavaScript.


---------------------------------------
- Dependencies
---------------------------------------

Athena-Graphics requires the following dependencies:

   - XMake
   - Athena-Math
   - Athena-Core
   - Athena-Entities
   - FreeImage
   - freetype
   - Ogre
   - rapidjson
   - UnitTest++
   - zlib
   - zziplib

They are provided as GIT submodules of this repository and will be compiled
automatically during the compilation of Athena-Graphics.

To download them, do:

    somewhere$ cd <path/to/the/source/of/Athena-Graphics>
    Athena-Graphics$ git submodule init
    Athena-Graphics$ git submodule update


---------------------------------------
- Compilation
---------------------------------------

(Note: you'll need to install CMake to compile Athena-Graphics)

To compile Athena-Graphics (and all its dependencies), do:

    somewhere$ mkdir build
    somewhere$ cd build
    build$ cmake <path/to/the/source/of/Athena-Graphics>
    build$ make

The library will be put in build/bin/
